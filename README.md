Simple project to test ofxFaceTracker and learn some OpenCV stuff. Basically, it uses face tracking, feature detection and countour finding to try to imitate Andy Warhol's Marilyn prints...

To compile this you need:
- ofxOpenCv (comes with oF)
- ofxCv (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
- ofxFaceTracker (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)

If you want to use the Makefile, you'll also need the develop branch of openFrameworks:
