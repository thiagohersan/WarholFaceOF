Simple project to test ofxFaceTracker and learn some OpenCV stuff. Basically, it uses face tracking, feature detection and countour finding to tryto imitate Andy Warhol's Marylin prints...

To compile this you need:
- ofxOpenCv (comes with oF)
- ofxCv (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
- ofxFaceTracker (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)

If you want to use the Makefile, you'll also need the develop branch of openFrameworks:
